## simple-genetic-algorithm

This is an implementation of the Simple Genetic Algorithm, which is described in chapter 1
of David Goldberg's "Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning".

It is implemented entirely in a Jupyter notebook.

Benchmarks and decoders that were implemented and tested here are:

* [DeJong function (Sphere function)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sphere_function_in_3D.pdf)
* [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function)
* [Himmelblau's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmelblau%27s_function)
* [Elementary Symmetric Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial)
